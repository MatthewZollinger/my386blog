Human experience demands to be shared. Throughout history, art, music, and written language have expressed the range of human emotion and experience. Techonology has dramatically increased the reach of people who want their voices heard - though at times one may feel they are yelling into the void.
Hence, the humble blog.

### What am I planning on doing for my "how-to" post?

Um, web scraping, I suppose. I'm rather interested in improving my web scraping skills.

### What book are you planning on reading for data science ethics?

*The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* by Shoshana Zuboff. I'm already 15% of the way through the audiobook!

### Where are you hoping to get data for your main class project?

Uh, Kaggle? Or maybe I'll just scrape it all myself! With a will, there's a way.
