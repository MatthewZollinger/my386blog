## TriviAnalysis

Hello! I'm Matthew Zollinger (he/him). I am a senior studying statistics at Brigham Young University. I have taken many classes within the stat department here but have found data science to be a particular interest of mine.

This blog will feature several analyses, reviews, and/or tutorials relating to data, and likely to pop culture as well. Hope you enjoy it!
